## Migration

### Running the Migration Script

Before running the migration, ensure you have:
1. A backup of your database
2. The `MONGO_URI` or `MONGODB_URI` environment variable set

```bash
cd Zuperr-BackEnd
node migrations/migrate-employer-to-company.js
```

The migration script:
- Is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Groups employers by company name
- Creates Company documents from employer data
- Links employers to companies via `companyId`
- Assigns the first employer in each group as "admin", others as "member"
- Skips employers already migrated (have `companyId`)

---

## Backward Compatibility

All existing employer APIs remain functional:
- Employer registration/login unchanged
- Existing employer endpoints work as before
- Company data can be accessed via employer (for backward compatibility) or directly via company endpoints

---

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication via JWT token:
```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

The token contains:
- `userId`: ID of the authenticated user
- `userType`: "User" or "Employer"

---

## Error Responses

All endpoints return errors in this format:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad request
- `401`: Unauthorized (no token)
- `403`: Forbidden (no permission)
- `404`: Not found
- `409`: Conflict (e.g., duplicate review)
- `500`: Server error

---

## Integration Hooks

The following placeholders are included for future features:

### Analytics
Company model includes:
- `analyticsEnabled`: Boolean flag
- Can be extended with telemetry data

### Sponsored Features
Company model includes:
- `sponsoredTier`: "none", "basic", "premium"
- Can be extended with sponsorship analytics
